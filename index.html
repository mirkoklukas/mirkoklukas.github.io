<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About.</h3>
<p>I'm a German mathematician with a PhD and a Master's degree in pure mathematics from the University of Cologne, Germany. Although my field of research is of purely abstract and conceptual nature (the technologies involved don't reach beyond whiteboards and markers) I have always been interested and passioned about programming and technology.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 2013 I signed with a global technology and management consulting company. However, my passion for complex problems has never been fully satisfied and eventually I quit to attend <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a>.</p>

<p>I always wanted to study art but became a mathematician. For most people there seems to be a big gap between those two worlds, but they actually feel the same in my head :)</p>
